/**
 * A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.

 The world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells, where 0 represents uninfected cells,
 and 1 represents cells contaminated with the virus. A wall (and only one wall)
 can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.

 Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall.
 Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region --
 the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night.

 There will never be a tie.

 Can you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required? If not, and the world becomes fully infected,
 return the number of walls used.

 Example 1:
 Input: grid =
 [[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
 Output: 10
 Explanation:
 There are 2 contaminated regions.
 On the first day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the left. The board after the virus spreads is:

 [[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]

 On the second day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the right. The virus is fully contained.
 Example 2:
 Input: grid =
 [[1,1,1],
 [1,0,1],
 [1,1,1]]
 Output: 4
 Explanation: Even though there is only one cell saved, there are 4 walls built.
 Notice that walls are only built on the shared boundary of two different cells.
 Example 3:
 Input: grid =
 [[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1],
 [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
 Output: 13
 Explanation: The region on the left only builds two new walls.
