package RemoveSubFoldersfromtheFilesystem;

import java.util.*;

/**
 * Given a list of folders, remove all sub-folders in those folders and return in any order the folders after removing.
 *
 * If a folder[i] is located within another folder[j], it is called a sub-folder of it.
 *
 * The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: / followed by one or more lowercase English letters. For example, /leetcode and /leetcode/problems are valid paths while an empty string and / are not.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
 * Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
 * Explanation: Folders "/a/b/" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
 * Output: ["/a"]
 * Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d/" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
 * Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
