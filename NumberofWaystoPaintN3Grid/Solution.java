/**
 * You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colours: Red, Yellow or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same colour (i.e no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same colour).
 *
 * You are given n the number of rows of the grid.
 *
 * Return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 10^9 + 7.xs
