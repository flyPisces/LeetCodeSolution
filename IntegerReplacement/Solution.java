/**
 * Given a positive integer n and you can do operations as follow:

 If n is even, replace n with n/2.
 If n is odd, you can replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
 What is the minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1?

 Example 1:

 Input:
 8

 Output:
 3

 Explanation:
 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
 Example 2:

 Input:
 7

 Output:
 4

 Explanation:
 7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
 or
 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
