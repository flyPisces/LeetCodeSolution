/**
 * Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you can build from them.

 A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string,
 where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

 For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because each word
 reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

 b a l l
 a r e a
 l e a d
 l a d y
 Note:
 There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
 All words will have the exact same length.
 Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
 Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.
 Example 1:

 Input:
 ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]

 Output:
 [
 [ "wall",
 "area",
 "lead",
 "lady"
 ],
 [ "ball",
 "area",
 "lead",
 "lady"
 ]
 ]

 Explanation:
 The output consists of two word squares.
 The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
 Example 2:

 Input:
 ["abat","baba","atan","atal"]

 Output:
 [
 [ "baba",
 "abat",
 "baba",
 "atan"
 ],
 [ "baba",
 "abat",
 "baba",
 "atal"
 ]
 ]

 Explanation:
 The output consists of two word squares.
 The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
