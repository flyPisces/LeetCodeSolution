/**
 * Given a m * n matrix mat of ones (representing soldiers) and zeros (representing civilians), return the indexes of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from the weakest to the strongest.
 *
 * A row i is weaker than row j, if the number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j, or they have the same number of soldiers but i is less than j. Soldiers are always stand in the frontier of a row, that is, always ones may appear first and then zeros.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: mat =
 * [[1,1,0,0,0],
 *  [1,1,1,1,0],
 *  [1,0,0,0,0],
 *  [1,1,0,0,0],
 *  [1,1,1,1,1]],
 * k = 3
 * Output: [2,0,3]
 * Explanation:
 * The number of soldiers for each row is:
 * row 0 -> 2
 * row 1 -> 4
 * row 2 -> 1
 * row 3 -> 2
 * row 4 -> 5
 * Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [2,0,3,1,4]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: mat =
 * [[1,0,0,0],
 *  [1,1,1,1],
 *  [1,0,0,0],
 *  [1,0,0,0]],
 * k = 2
 * Output: [0,2]
 * Explanation:
 * The number of soldiers for each row is:
 * row 0 -> 1
 * row 1 -> 4
 * row 2 -> 1
 * row 3 -> 1
 * Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [0,2,3,1]
