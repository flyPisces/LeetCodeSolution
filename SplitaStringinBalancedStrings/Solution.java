package SplitaStringinBalancedStrings;

/**
 * Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
 *
 * Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.
 *
 * Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
